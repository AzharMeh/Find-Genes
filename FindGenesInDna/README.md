# Find Genes In DNA

## Description :   

It is a Genome Science Project.
This program helps to find the genes in Dna strings. dna code is made of letter A, C, G, and T. 
These letters are abbreviated as Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T).
Dna codons are made of three letters for example ATG, TAA, TCA, TGA and their combination makes the Dna String.
gene in Dna starts with start codon and end with stop codon a string can have many genes in it.
this program take dna string find ATG in String as start codon and return all the genes inside the string which end with the three stop codon (gene lenth is multiple of three) TAA, TGA, TAG.

## How it works :   

 To run this project Please Install jar file from https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2 for package edu.duke which has ApI such as FileResource.
 
 Program takes text file as input which has the DNA string and perform operation on String it contains, It only work with DNA Strings which contains Gene codons made of letter A, C, G, T and the String will look like ("ACTTCAATAATGGTATAATGATCAATGTAA") or ("acgtgaatggaatagtgaataatgtag").
 
 Program will print All the Gene Strings and return a String array it also contains other methods which can be helpful by changing them according to requirment.
